# Element's user guide

Element is a "decentralized instant messaging software based on the Matrix protocol". Basically, this tool allows you to communicate securely, with people using other applications, in open source, and without data mining. 

This means of communication brings together the Virtual Assembly and the Paths of Transition's communities. It allows any contributor to express himself freely on the projects carried out, to be informed of the various meetings planned or to participate in decision-making. 
These communities are therefore divided into different chats related to topics. 
By the way, you can meet the Transiscope community here : https://chat.lescommuns.org/channel/transiscope-accueil. 

Firstly, Element can be used directly on your browser : https://app.element.io/?pk_vid=3967c7bf75ff37e81596549874c37b51#/welcome.

But we also recommend that you download the mobile application : ![](https://pad.lescommuns.org/uploads/upload_3716b408c1a2d8b27d2907f2a03bbcc4.png)
