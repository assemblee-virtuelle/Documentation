# Github's user guide

New contributor ? 
First of all, welcome :) 
In order to follow the progress of the VA's projects as closely as possible and to participate in the life of our community, what better way than to become familiar with the tools provided for this purpose ?!
Here is a tutorial that will allow you to enter the adventure without too many difficulties. 

Originally, Github is a cloud-based platform for building software projects. It facilitates the collaboration of developers on the same code, which will be stored and will evolve according to the modifications that each one will bring to it. 
Running in open source, Github becomes an interesting tool for managing collaborative projects like ours, because it allows any member to get involved and follow the changes made in time. 
**To go further** : In fact, Github is an interface for [GIT](https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial) that only runs on the command line (for developers then).

## How to sign up ?

It's very simple ! 
1. Go to [Github's](https://github.com/) platform and click on "sign up".
2. Enter your personal informations (email address, password, username).
3. Make sure to be invited by the active contributor with whom you are in contact, by giving him/her your email address or username.
4. That's it! All you have to do now is sign in.

## Several important keys you need when following the projects of the AV/the POT

When you're on the home page, you will find an access to the different repositories and teams you have just joined.

If you click, for example, on a project/repository, you will access a page like the one below :

* The **_Code_** heading corresponds to all written documents that are used for the project in question. You can add a new file by clicking on "add file". You have two options : 
  - Click on "create new file" to edit a new document directly on the platform.
  - Click on "upload file" to add a document you already have.
Before clicking on "commit changes" in order to upload your new file or to modify an already existing file, make sure to check the second option (see picture below). This option will allow you to suggest a merging of your contribution to the project's "common core". Doing this will consequently put your file in the "Pull request" section. The contributors you chose to assign (cf "Issues" section below) will then be able to add their modifications, leave comments and decide whether or not to add your file to the project.

**_Warning_** : Github uses a markup language called Markdown. Some shortcuts are needed in order to bring the necessary syntax to your file (bold, italic...). **When you create a new file, make sure to add ".md" after the title**. ==> Here is the link to a [quick tutorial for writing in Markdown ](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) offered by Github.


* The **_issues_** section allows all contributors to submit their suggestions/ideas that could be interesting to feed the project. You are free to create a new issue by clicking on "new issue", and to comment it if you want to add some details. On the right side of the screen, you will find the following options : 
  - "Assignments" allows you to assign this outcome to a member.
  - "Labels" allows you to allocate the labels that may concern your issue (for example, if you want to report any malfunction on the VA site, you can add the label "glitch").
  - "Projects" allows you to link your issue to a project. You can specify if your suggestion is to be done, in progress, to be validated, or finished.

* The **_Projects_** heading is directly linked to the issues, as it corresponds to their processing. Indeed, active contributors can create a project, and choose whether or not to add the suggestions made in the 'issues' section. When you click on a project, the following page appears : 

![](https://pad.lescommuns.org/uploads/upload_3515d43fadf06ebd5de079c45065f9f3.png)

You will find the following steps : To do ; In progress ; Done (after the confirmation of active members). You are able to move the cards according to the progress of your issue. 
The "+" at the top of each column allows you to add new cards. 

* The **_Pull requests_** section allows you to find all the documents being edited, which have not yet been merged with the "common core" (the master branch) of the project, and which are therefore still subject to modifications by the people assigned as "reviewers". When you access a "pull request", the following page appears : 
  - "Conversation" is a timeline of all the changes and comments made to this file.
  - "Commits" corresponds to the different versions of this document (from the oldest to the most recent). 
  - "Files changed" allows you to view all the changes made to a document. What is highlighted in red corresponds to what has been replaced by what is highlighted in green.

**If you are the editor of the document and you want to modify it** : click on the last commit, then on the three small dots in the top right corner of the document, and finally on "Edit file".

**If you are a reviewer of the document and want to add your comments on it**: In the "Files changed" section, click on "Review changes", write your comment while making sure to check the "Comment" option, and then click on "submit request". Your comment will appear in the "Conversation" section in order to be processed by the document editor.

**If you consider that your document is complete, and that all the reviewers are satisfied with its final version** : you can click on "Merge pull request" and then on "Confirm merge" which will allow you to merge your file with the project. Then, you will find it in the "Code" section.
