# Tutorial : How to redirect emails from your pro OVH/Outlook mailbox to your personal mailbox ?

You want to actively contribute to the Virtual Assembly projects, but can't bear getting lost between different mailboxes ? This tutorial was made for you! 

1. First of all, ensure that your professional email address (...@virtual-assembly.org) has been successfully created by a member of the VA.
2. Once the email address is created, go to the [following portal](mail.ovh.net) and log in with your identifiers.
3. You just accessed your Outlook mailbox. Click on the settings button at the top right of the window and then on "Options".

6. The window that appears allows you to define this new rule.
   - Name your rule (for example "Redirection").
   - Choose the conditions for redirecting your emails (if you want to redirect all your professional emails to your personal mailbox, click on "Apply        to all messages").
   - Click on "Redirect the message to". ![](https://pad.lescommuns.org/uploads/upload_fec9050f0cc5b30395f60095520b4a6d.png)
   - Enter your personal email address as in the image below ![](https://pad.lescommuns.org/uploads/upload_3848c2be60f3efd0d9cde2282a1b3486.png) and          click on "Use this address" then "Save".
  
7. Just click on "OK" in the top left corner of the window and your rule will be saved. 
8. However, **if you want your emails to be automatically deleted from your pro mailbox when redirected to your personal mailbox** : 
   - Click on "Add action".
   - Then on "Move, copy, or delete"...
   - And finally on "Delete the message"![](https://pad.lescommuns.org/uploads/upload_e7abcc6d2f7624fbf61daccab63d03c5.png)
   - Click on "OK" in the top left corner of the window and your rule will be saved.
