# Access Virtual Assembly's Google Drive

New contributor ? 
First of all, welcome :)
For more transparency in the management of projects or the life of communities, the Virtual Assembly make sure to share with its contributors all the documents related to its activities.

Thus, if you have a google account, you can access the [drive of the VA/CDLT](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0By8nyiKT594tc2FaaHFPaFlfNk0?usp=sharing). You will find their different projects, the membership circles, their social code (very important to understand VA's values), and even their bills (if you're a curious one).
